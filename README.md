## Video Demonstration Overview
The video provides a walkthrough of the Smart Organizer script.

- Demo files are moved to directories based on the file type.
- Existing directories are left unchanged. In the video, a folder containing a single file remains untouched, ensuring that the directory structure is preserved.
- While not shown in the demo, the script is designed to be customizable, allowing users to add or modify file extension types and corresponding directories as needed.
